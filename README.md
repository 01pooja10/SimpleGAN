# SimpleGAN
This is an introductory &amp; comprehensible re-implementation of the infamous __Generative Adversarial Network__ (Goodfellow et al.) [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661) which consists of a GAN trained on MNIST images and has been coded using the PyTorch framework.

This is meant to be a beginner-friendly, working GAN model which can generate handwritten digits(1-10) and is visualized using TensorBoard. The results, upon successful completion of the project, will be displayed below. Various

## Implementation
The Generative Adversarial Network consists of 2 models namely, the generative and discriminative models which are Deep Neural Networks. The generative and discriminative models compete against each other in the same environment where, one (generative model) works to generate fake data and the other (discriminative model) tries to differentiate between the fake and original data.

The objective of the discriminative model is to maximize the probability of assigning accurate labels to data samples as to whether they originated from the actual dataset or have been generated by the generative model.
The objective of the generative model is to minimize the probability of the discriminator identifying real data i.e. to produce spitting replicas of the images in the original dataset.
